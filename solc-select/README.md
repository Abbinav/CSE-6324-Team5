# solc-select
A tool to quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions.

The tool is split into two CLI utilities:
- `solc-select`: manages installing and setting different `solc` compiler versions
- `solc`: wrapper around `solc` which picks the right version according to what was set via `solc-select`

The `solc` binaries are downloaded from https://binaries.soliditylang.org/ which contains
official artifacts for many historial and modern `solc` versions for Linux and macOS.

The downloaded binaries are stored in `~/.solc-select/artifacts/`.

## Quickstart

```
pip3 install solc-select
```

## Usage

The global version of `solc` can be set with the `solc-select use <version>` command:
```
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++
$ solc-select use 0.4.24
Switched global version to 0.4.24
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++
```

Use `SOLC_VERSION` environment variable to override the global version:
```
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++
$ SOLC_VERSION=0.5.2 solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++
```

You can list all available versions with `solc-select install`:
```
$ solc-select install
Available versions to install:
0.3.6
0.4.0
...
0.8.0
0.8.1
```

And install the one you need with with `solc-select install <version>`:
```
$ solc-select install 0.8.1
Installing '0.8.1'...
Version '0.8.1' installed.
```

Display the currently installed versions:
```
$ solc-select versions
0.8.0
0.4.2 (current, set by /Users/artur/.solc-select/global-version)
```
