The binary addition can overflow.
The operands of the addition operation are not sufficiently constrained. The addition could therefore result in an integer overflow. Prevent the overflow by checking inputs or ensure sure that the overflow is caught by an assertion.

Sending of Ether depends on the blockhash.
The predictable expression 'block.blockhash(block.number)' is used to determine Ether recipient, this expression will always be equal to zero.

Function name: guess(uint256)

Sending of Ether depends on a predictable variable.
The contract sends Ether depending on the values of the following variables:
- block.number
Note that the values of variables like coinbase, gaslimit, block number and timestamp are predictable and/or can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Don't use them for random number generation or to make critical decisions.

Anyone can withdraw ETH from the contract account.
Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can withdraw ETH from the contract account without previously having sent an equivalent amount of ETH to it. This is likely to be a vulnerability.
