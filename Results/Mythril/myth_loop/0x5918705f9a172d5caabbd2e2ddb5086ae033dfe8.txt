==== Multiple Calls in a Single Transaction ====
SWC ID: 113
Severity: Low
Contract: TokenDecimalsView
Function name: getTokenDecimals(address[])
PC address: 480
Estimated Gas Usage: 2987 - 75731
Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. theyâ€™re part of your own codebase).
